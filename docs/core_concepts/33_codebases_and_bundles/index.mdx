# Codebases & Bundles

:::note

Codebases is Beta, only works with typescript and is an enterprise feature for the time being

:::

The traditional way to handle codebases on Windmill is two-fold:

- Using [relative imports](../../advanced/6_imports/index.mdx#relative-imports) to import scripts from the same workspace
- Deploy a private/public packages and import them in your scripts [using the package manager](../../advanced/6_imports/index.mdx#private-npm-registry--private-npm-packages)

However, that can be inconvenient when working with large codebases.

## Bundles

To that end, there is a new mode of deployment that relies on the same mechanism than similar services like lambda or cloud functions: A bundle is build locally by the CLI using esbundle and deployed to Windmill.

This bundle contains all the code and dependencies needed to run the script.

On the latest version of the Windmill CLI, it is done automatically on `wmill sync push` for script that falls in the patterns of includes and excludes as defined below.

## wmill.yaml

```yaml
---
codebases:
  - relative_path: ../codebase
    includes:
      - '**'
    excludes: []
```

Windmill keep track of the hash of the codebase and will only rebuild the bundle if the codebase or script has changed.

## Vscode extension

This mode of deployment automatically work with the vscode extension to run preview by recognizing the `codebases` configuration in wmill.yaml and bundling scripts on the fly using the same esbundle.
